This is a skeleton project meant for quickstart projects and ideas. The only thing required to run is NPM. Browsersync and Node Sass are ready to roll. Simply clone/download, install node dependencies(`npm install`) and then run `npm run start`. Browsersync will launch the single file site open and Node Sass is watching for scss changes to be made. Changes will reflect live in the browser.
